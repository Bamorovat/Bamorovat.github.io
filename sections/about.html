    <div class="card">
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
            I am an <strong>Autonomy Scientist</strong> at AIDRIVERS, London, with over 15 years of experience in robotics, 
            autonomous systems, and machine learning. I hold a <strong>Ph.D. in Computer Science</strong> from the University of 
            Hertfordshire, where I specialized in human activity recognition for ambient assisted living scenarios under the supervision 
            of Prof. Farshid Amirabdollahian.

            Currently, I work at <strong>AIDRIVERS</strong> leading the development of real-time autonomy stack for autonomous vehicles 
            in PSA Singapore smart port. Previously, I worked as a Robotic Software Specialist at the University of Manchester 
            and as a Perception Team Engineer at Conigital, where I developed advanced driver monitoring systems, multi-sensor fusion 
            algorithms, and deep learning models for autonomous vehicles. My expertise spans the entire perception pipeline, from sensor 
            calibration to real-time processing and validation of safety-critical systems.

        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
            Throughout my career, I have successfully led research teams, published numerous peer-reviewed papers, and delivered innovative 
            solutions in both academic and industrial settings. My passion lies in bridging the gap between theoretical research and 
            practical applications, particularly in robotics and computer vision technologies that enhance human life and safety.
