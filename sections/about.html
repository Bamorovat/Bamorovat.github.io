<h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        I work as an <strong>Autonomy Scientist</strong> at AIDRIVERS, where I bring together robotics, perception and machine learning to build robust autonomy systems. My PhD from the University of Hertfordshire gave me a foundation in human activity recognition and dataset creation, and since then my work has followed a common thread: turning careful research into practical systems that operate reliably in the real world.

        My career has alternated between research and applied engineering. In industry I led R&amp;D at GEIT.Co, where I headed projects that produced hospital robots and RoboCup coaching tools and implemented ROS-based coordination and navigation. I later focused on perception and sensor-fusion as a Perception Engineer at Conigital and worked as a Robotic Software Specialist at the University of Manchester, developing driver monitoring systems and deep learning models that bridge prototype research and deployment.

        Teaching and mentoring have always been part of my practice. I was a Visiting Lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire, teaching Machine Learning, HCI and Research Ethics and supervising MSc dissertations in AI and robotics. Earlier I lectured at universities in Guilan, delivering courses on Embedded Systems, Robotics and C/C++, and I continue to mentor students and junior researchers to help them move ideas from concept to working systems.
